# PCA-Of-IRIS-Dataset
Performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the IRIS dataset to reduce its dimensionality from four features to two principal components. This helped visualize the data more effectively while preserving most of its variance. The transformed data was plotted to observe class separability among different iris species.
